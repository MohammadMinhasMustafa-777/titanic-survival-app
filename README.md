# titanic-survival-app
Titanic survival predictor with Flask + Render deployment

Titanic survival app through flask is basically about making prediction regarding the fact that which passenger survived and who did not. The train data was downloaded from kaggle and then random forest model with hyperparameters was trained on training data through GridSearch CV with 5 folds. Predictions are then made via best trained model by hel[ping user with the facility of flask app. Render helped create a url through which anyone can go and give it a shot by entering some user inputs.
