Titanic survival predictor with Flask + PythonAnywhere deployment

The Titanic Survival App built with Flask is designed to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The training dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and a Random Forest model was optimized using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation. Once the best model was selected, predictions are served through the Flask application, allowing users to input passenger details and receive survival predictions. Deployment was handled via PythonAnywhere, which generated a public URL so anyone can access the app and test it with their own inputs.
